## Analysis of free market article

Hayek debate vs nature: 

- in debate: 
  - no mention of socialist/socialism
  - really important in the other one
  - competition (only here), quite surprising
  - also solution
  - question vs discussion
  
- planning: important in both
  
- Pierson: 
  - quite different from Hayek
  - no planning
  - no discussion / question (with whom would be any?!)
  - Influence of BÃ¶hm-Bawerk? capital, exchange, income?, labor -> different time, different perspective?

- von Mises: 
  - again no discussion, question
  - exchange (with Pierson?)
  - calculation, economic, production 
    - calculation: name giver

The previous was for me to see the key differences, but instead show this:

![](free_market_word_free_y.png)

The below figure shows what words authors use in a similar frequency and what are different. 
Texts that are closer to the abline don't suggest for big differences, for example system in Hayek: 35X, in Pierson: 31X. But discussion: Hayek 27X, Pierson: 2X

- may be a meaningful comparison, since we might be able to track the arguments of the free-marketers in time 
- Pierson: capital, exchange, international, demand, labour, communism (!)
  - calculation already there! 
  - doesn't mention: planning, central, rational, mises
- Hayek: institutions (!), real with which word (biagram!), production
  - doesn't mention: rate, services, foreign, bills



vons Mises vs Hayek: 

- Hayek: analysis, direction
- calculation in both (calculation & calculations)
- capitalism (!)
- 1920 ?
- doesn't mention: monetary, commonwealth, business, bank

Mises: 

- consumption
- exchange, capital, material, labor (Pierson)
- money (BB)
- doesn't mention: planning, discussion, professor (?)
