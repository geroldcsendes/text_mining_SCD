## Analysis of free market article

Hayek debate vs nature: 

- in debate: 
  - no mention of socialist/socialism
  - really important in the other one
  - competition (only here), quite surprising
  - also solution
  - question vs discussion
  
- planning: important in both
  
- Pierson: 
  - quite different from Hayek
  - no planning
  - no discussion / question (with whom would be any?!)
  - Influence of BÃ¶hm-Bawerk? capital, exchange, income?, labor -> different time, different perspective?

- von Mises: 
  - again no discussion, question
  - exchange (with Pierson?)
  - calculation, economic, production 
    - calculation: name giver
